        <h3>The Relationship between HTML, CSS & JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
          Great news! I've got three children & they're triplets. Their names
          are HTML, CSS & Javascript. Let me tell you all about them:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML: The Scholar</li>
          You can usually find HTML with his head buried in a book. He's
          obsessed with organization & structure. The more he grows up, the more
          he insists on things being kept a certain way.
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>CSS: The Artist</li>
          She's up to date with the latest styles & trends. You can find her
          drawing or painting, usually all over my walls. She seems to be
          inspired by the things she picks up and learns off of her brother,
          HTML.
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>Javascript: The Wizard</li>
          Javascript is complicated. He can be difficult, but he's incredibly
          intelligent & cares a lot about his siblings. He's always trying to
          make life easier & funner for everyone!
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because I'm a good mother, I don't expect my three children to be good
          at everything. That's unreasonable & cruel. My kids are all talented
          in their own different ways. All I ask of them is to get along with
          each other. Collaboration is important & they shine the most when
          they're communicating & working with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u
            ><i
              >The take away here is: HTML defines the structure of your
              content, CSS determines the style and layout, Javascript makes the
              content interactive.</i
            ></u
          >

        <h3>Control Flow</h3>
        <p>
          How would you read a book? You'd probably start at the very top & work
          your way down, right? We humans read books; computers are reading
          code. The order in which a computer progresses & executes commands is
          exactly like how we read books - computers also start from line 1!
        </p>

        <h3>Loops</h3>
        <p>
          Computers have a programming tool called, a loop. A loop is a series
          of statements that executes continuously until a condition is met.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a scenario. I'm studying for my exam. I'm having a difficult
          time understanding this one section, so I've been re-reading it over &
          over again.
        </p>
        <br />

        <img class="sp" src="/images/examples/loop.png" alt="cat" />

        <br />
        <p>
          In an attempt to study, I've created a loop - I've read & tried to
          understand repeatedly, over and over for a total of 5 times! Even
          though I've completed the loop & I still don't understand, I'll move
          on.
          <br />

              executes continuously until a condition is met.</i

        <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
        <p>
          The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application that helps us
          navigate webpages. It serves as an interface that allows programming
          languages to access and manipulate objects within a web page.
        </p>
        <br />

        <img class="sp" src="/images/examples/dom-tree-01.png" alt="cat" />

        <p>
          When you go on your phone & you want to listen to music, do you launch
          your music app & manually scroll through every single song known to
          mankind to find that one song you feel like listening to? No, right?
          Or at least, I hope you wouldn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, there are tools built for navigation! If you're looking
          for something, you look for the search button. In a similar fashion,
          programmers are able to use the DOM to navigate webpages. Except,
          they're able to do this & so much more.
        </p>

              for programmers working with webpages.</i

        <h3>Arrays & Objects</h3>
        <p>
          Arrays are containers, ordered lists of information. Here are some key
          points about arrays:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Declaration: To create an array, you use the square brackets '[]'
            and input your elements inside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ordered Collection: Arrays store elements in a specific order.
          </li>
          <li>
            Counting: When counting elements within an array, you don't begin
            with 1, you begin with 0.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mixed Data Types: Arrays can hold different types of data in each
            element. You can have numbers, strings, objects, all in the same
            array.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <img class="sp" src="/images/examples/array.png" alt="cat" />

        <p>
          Objects are also containers of information. Objects store related
          information in the form of 'key-value' pairs. Here are some key points
          about objects:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Declaration: To create an object, you use the curly braces '{}' and
            define it's properties inside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Key-Value Pairs: Objects store data as pairs of keys and values.
          </li>
          <li>Properties: Keys in objects are called properties.</li>
          <li>
            Mixed Data Types: Like arrays, objects can hold different types of
            data. You can have numbers, strings and even arrays, so long as the
            object is formatted properly.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <img class="sp" src="/images/examples/object.png" alt="cat" />

        <p>
          <u
            ><i>
              The take away here is: Although arrays & objects are very similar,
              they're not to be mixed up! They're two very different things! Use
              the example images above to differentiate them!

        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>
          Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task.
          Here are some key points about functions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Purpose: Functions contain instructions that get executed when you
            use them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Parameters: Functions take in inputs, these are called parameters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Return: After finishing it's job, a function can give you a
            return(ed) value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reusability: Once functions are defined, they can be reused multiple
            times through out your code.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <img class="sp" src="/images/examples/function.png" alt="cat" />
        <p>
          <u
            ><i>
              The take away here is: Functions are handy tools that let you
              organize tasks & reuse code.
