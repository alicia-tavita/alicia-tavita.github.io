        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I'm kind of a perfectionist (at the very least I have tendencies)
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>
          If I'm not immediately good at something, I hate it & don't want to do
          it
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>Therefore I give up quite easily</li>

        The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programming involves extensive collaboration within teams, where working
        together necessitates connection, and fostering this connection relies
        on having values, empathy & self awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a technical context, you can demonstrate empathy by consciously
        considering others when coding, ensuring your work allows others to
        seamlessly continue where you left off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engaging in empathetic actions, such as regularly checking in on and
        supporting your peers or coworkers, can significantly contribute to
        building strong rapport.

        What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
      </p>
      <p>
        Honestly, after spending hours & hours doing Tech exercizes, when I
        finally reach Human Skills, I feel so relieved. It's like being in a
        game where there's no auto-save. When you finally see that sight of
        grace after hours of grinding, it feels like you can finally breathe
        easy again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love Human Skills, it is the nicer part of my school week. Maybe in
        the near-future, after further developing my JS skills, I will enjoy
        Tech exercizes more than the Human exercizes.

        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </p>
      <p>
        Figuring out how to apply the information to myself. It's all well &
        good learning all of this information & retaining it - it's a completely
        different story to enaction it into your own life. I find that
        difficult.

        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </p>
      <p>
        I've seen & felt the benefits of learning these Human Skills first-hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        There've been a few moments where I've been stuck & have gotten
        extremely frustrated because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's very easy to ruminate & to spiral when you're not in a good
        head-space. I myself am quite prone to this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developing my learning around things like Neuroplasticity has been
        really good for my overall health.

        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
        waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
        programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        If anything, I just find myself wishing there was more time in the day
        so that I could practice programming more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The time I've put into studying Human Skills has been well-spent. I
        really appreciate that this course has been encouraging self-care.
