        <p>
          My mom always told me growing up that I should do what I love. I'm not
          sure I really
          <i>love</i> to do anything. I'm enjoying learning about coding &
          web-development right now through this course and to me, that's
          enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm at the point where I'm still trying to pin-point which parts of
          coding are fun/enjoyable for me. When I figure that out, I think I'll
          know where to go from there.
        </p>
        <p>
          My long-term plan is to do what I want & take it a day at a time. My
          long-term goal is to be secure & happy.

          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The biggest strength I have approaching bootcamp is my perspective
            on 'allowing'.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After a month of being a full-time student, with nothing else really
          going on in my life, the importance of community and support has
          really presented itself to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been making more of an effort to go out and visit my family, make
          plans with friends. I've been trying to interact with my peers,
          neighbours & strangers whenever the opportuinities arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've become more open & have allowed myself to be more vulnerable &
          honest with others. I suppose, in the same kind of way, I've allowed
          myself to be more vulnerable & honest with myself too.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can admit when I feel frustrated or when I'm struggling. These days
          instead of shaming myself, I just sit & allow these feelings to pass.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The biggest limitation I think I'll face during bootcamp is
            perfectionism.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          "Perfectionism is the belief or desire that everything should be
          flawless or done perfectly, often leading to high standards that are
          difficult to achieve and stress when they're not met."
        </p>
        <p>
          Through out foundations, I've been able to learn more about myself and
          one of the things I've learnt is I'm a bit of a perfectionist. If I'm
          not naturally or immediately good at things, I get extremely
          frustrated.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tend to be quite hard on myself & when I reflect back on my time
          learning, I find myself wishing I'd done things differently/more
          efficiently, even though I know in my head that I was only doing what
          I thought/knew was best at the time.

          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
          will be?
        </p>
        <p>
          Impostor Syndrome. I feel like I'm quite prone to belittling myself.
          Whether it be my ambitions or efforts, I have a bad habit of making
          myself feel unworthy.
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <p>
          I can't believe I'm admitting this in a school blog but I think I have
          low self-esteem. I suppose this is where a-lot of my issues are
          rooted.

        <p>
          I chose to develop myself in the IT field because there is immense
          potential. To be honest, I have no 5 year plan. My future is very
          unclear to me - as for what I want to do with my life, I've got no
          idea. The catch is, I value freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to allow myself the grace & room to be able to decide as I
          go. I'm confident in my abilities to succeed in this industry, there's
          endless opportunity for up-skilling & space for growth. This is enough
          for me.

        <ul>
          <li>Good at communicating. Wont hesitate to ask for help.</li>

          I would like to develop my tolerance towards other people. I have a
