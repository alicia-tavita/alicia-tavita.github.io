        I chose to develop myself in the IT field because there is immense
        potential. To be honest, I have no 5 year plan. My future is very
        unclear to me - as for what I want to do with my life, I've got no idea.
        The catch is, I value freedom. I wanted to allow myself the grace & room
        to be able to decide as I go. I'm confident in my abilities to succeed
        in this industry, there's endless opportunity for up-skilling & space
        for growth. This is enough for me.

      <p class="padding">My Strengths</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Good at communicating. Wont hesitate to ask for help.</li>
        <li>Good work ethic. I'm used to working hard.</li>
        <li>Confident in my abilities. I have a strong will to succeed.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="padding">My limitations</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Lack of prior knowledge. I'm a beginner.</li>
        <li>Procrastination. I need a deadline to motivate my work output.</li>
        <li>
          Tunnel-vision. When I'm in a good flow-state, it's hard for me to stop
          - to the point of over exhaustion.

        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </p>
      <p class="padding">
        I would like to develop my tolerance towards other people. I have a
        tendency to get impatient with others, specifically when I feel there is
        a lack of self awareness, common sense or care.

        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.

      <p class="padding">
        I commit to managing myself. I commit to working productively and safely
        with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
        representatives. I commit to seeking help when I need it. I am fully
        committed to succeeding in this course.

        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:
      </p>
      <p class="padding">
        I don't really expect anything from the Facilitation team. I'll always
        ask for help if I ever need it, but if the Facilitation team ever think
        I could benefit with some constructive criticism or whatever, by all
        means.

        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </p>
      <p class="padding">
        I've got no other commitments at this time. The only other commitment I
        have is to myself.
