      <h3>Coping with coding block</h3>
      <p>
        Coming into the third/fourth week of school, I was feeling pretty good.
        I'd become quite comfortable with using HTML & CSS in my first two weeks
        and I figured with the way things were going, I was bound to succeed in
        this course. Never in my life have I been humbled so fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's only been two weeks of me learning Javascript and somehow, I feel
        like I'm already somehow falling behind. This past week was especially
        hard for me. It's the weekend now & I'm trying my best not to stress out
        about school, but I'm still doing my blog because I'm playing catch up.
        It's been quite difficult - I've been feeling very confused, overwhelmed
        and exhuasted. I know this entry so far is sounding quite bleak and
        pessimistic but there is <i>always</i> a good side.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though things've been challenging - I believe it may only <i>feel</i> so
        drastic because I've been so comfortable for the past few years. I've
        spent the past few years sticking to what I know, staying strictly
        with-in my comfort zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the four short weeks I've been at Devacademy, I've already
        experienced so much valuable upskilling. I've been able to use my brain
        properly for the first time - my brain actually hurts from how much I've
        been using it and it's great! I'm learning how to regulate my emotions.
        I'm learning to be kinder to myself & to have more self compassion.
      </p>
      <p>
        I may've started this course with the idea of a better future in mind -
        I didn't realize how fun & fulfilling journey there could be too.

      <h3>Trying to Troubleshoot</h3>
      <p class="quest">
        "We're going to write a function that takes a number as an argument, if
        that number is a multiple of 3 the function will return 'Flip'. For
        multiples of 5 we will return 'Flop'. For numbers that are multiples of
        both 3 and 5, we will return 'FlipFlop'. If none of these cases are
        true, we're just going to return the number."
      </p>
      <p>
        This exercize in particular, I really struggled with. I tried to
        simplify the problem, research, try different methods - it seemed like
        nothing I did brought me closer to the answer. The longer I'd spent
        going around in circles, trying to figure this problem out - the more
        frustrated & upset I was becoming. I was stuck in a negative feedback
        loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        I ended up realizing, I'd get nowhere if I continued this way. It was
        clear to me, if I wanted to move forwards, I'd need to change something
        - I'd need to reset. I tunneled my way out of my study zone; went for a
        walk down the road, grabbed some coffee, came home & took a shower. Put
        on a non-school-related youtube video while I cooked lasagna. Only after
        all this, did I sit back down & attempt the problem again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Funnily enough, even after all of this, I still couldn't figure it out.
        I ended up reaching out to one of my class-mates & they agreed to help
        me. We got on call, they guided me through the problem & helped me
        understand where I was going wrong. They explained the problem in such a
        way that it was so easy for me to understand, I regretted not reaching
        out sooner. I've since made it a regular practice to interupt myself in
        studying/working & to ask for help when I'm stuck!!

      <h3>Rating Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pseudocode</li>
        10/10 - Legendary. I have a habit or jotting down thoughts I don't want
        to lose. Pseudocode feels like a computer version of this. Great for
        referencing!
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
        10/10 - Legendary. I enjoy talking to myself. Probably wouldn't do this
        in a public setting though.
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>Reading error messages</li>
        7/10 - Good. Sometimes I have a hard time understanding what I'm
        reading, my technical comprehension skills aren't the best.
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>Console logging</li>
        6/10 - Good. Though I understand it & how useful it is, I'm not in the
        habit of actively praciticing it or using it. Will get round to it!
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
        9/10 - Great. I have a weekly discord call & in-person meeting with one
        of my class-mates.
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
        8/10 - Great. I've only asked for help once but the response I recieved
        was very genuine & helpful. It's inspired me to speak up more when I
        need help.
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
        9/10 - Great. I journal religiously so this method is right up my alley.
