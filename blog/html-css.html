    <h3>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h3>
    <p>When using classes & IDs in HTML and CSS, you'll want to learn what the differences are & in what context to use them. Let's learn about some of the best practices we can use!</p>
  <p>
      <strong>IDs</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>Identification: IDs should be unique within a page. They are commonly used to identify a specific element. They help with keeping track of your unique components.</li>
      <li>Style Specificity: IDs are more specific than classes. This means if styles conflict, the ID will overwrite a class.</li>
      </ul>
     <strong>Classes:</strong>
     <ul>
      <li>Reusability: Classes are useful because they're reusable and can be applied to many different elements. They help with keeping your designs more consitent and cohesive.</li>
      <li>CSS Specificity: Classes are less specific than IDs. This means they can be overridden by more specific selectors, like IDs.</li>
      </ul>
     <strong>Best Practices:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Gauge specificity: When deciding between whether to use class or ID, think about the range of specificity you'll be needing.</li>
      <li>Be selective: Only use IDs for elements that are unique within a page.</li>
      <li>Choose Classes for general styling: Use classes to style groups of elements that are similar.</li>
      <li>Utilize external CSS files: Rememer to use external CSS files instead of using inline styles. This will help you keep everything nice & organized.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
