      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

      I come from places of dysfunction and stress. I am the eldest daughter of
      an ethnic household, born into expectations & responsibility. My whole
      childhood & teenage life consisted of nothing but cleaning & working. Like
      a good daughter, I quietly assumed my job as my families keeper & my
      mothers right hand.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">
      When I was 17 I cussed at my mother for the very first time, I shoved my
      clothes into rubbish bags and I ran away. A split second decision purely
      driven by emotion. No plans, no direction & no future - but, no one really
      runs away from home unless they're being chased.

      In hindsight, my life begun when I left. Looking back now, the only thing
      I regret is not taking that step sooner. I wish I didn't spend most of my
      life silently accepting & enduring.

      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.

      Against my upbringing, I've become someone who is good at putting
      themselves first. Things like establishing boundaries, respecting others,
      shifting perspective/s, questioning everything, reflecting
      consistently/constantly - these things are very important to me. I have a
      desire to live my life fully, present in all of its glory. To live in
      auto-pilot in contentment, is the same as death to me.

      articulating myself. I'm great at multi-tasking. I work well under

      efficiently independently, as well as with a team.

      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?

      I'm burnt out & lazy. I've been in the work-force since I was 7. I can be
      perceived as a bit insensitive and unprofessional when I've warmed up to
      my peers. I'm tired of & it's a bit difficult to motivate myself to do
      challenging things. Though I lack professionalism & self discipline, I am
      highly self aware.

      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.

      When I was in university, I was assigned a group project. Like any and
      every other group project ever, yourself & a few randomly selected peers
      collaborate on a project, to submit or present. The issue here was, the
      two class mates that I'd been grouped with, refused to do any work. I
      tried my best to connect with them & attempt to ask for contribution.
      Outside of class, if they'd even show up, they were impossible to connect
      with. Ultimately I came to the conclusion that it was out of my control.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">
      You can talk all you'd like but you can never get anyone to listen. I'd
      already decided that we were going to pass and I took initiative. Instead
      of seeing this situation as "This is so unfair, I can't believe I'm stuck
      doing this whole project by myself", I re-shifted perspectives and began
      to see it as "It's a blessing to have full control over this project. I
      decide the outcome of this situation".

    <p class="padding">
      The day before the presentation, I met with my group & I presented them
      with scripts, detailing everything they needed to learn. The presentation
      came, we presented. The results came, we got full marks. In hindsight, I
      would've just spoken to my professor about the situation I'd been given. I
      would've also presented my presentation by myself, instead of trying to
      help my group mates.
