        I am the eldest daughter of an ethnic household, born into expectations
        & responsibility. My whole childhood & teenage life consisted of nothing
        but cleaning & working. For the most part, I quietly assumed my job as
        my families keeper & my mothers right hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was 17 I cussed at my mother for the very first time, shoved my
        clothes into rubbish bags and ran away. The choice I'd made was not at
        all well thought out or smart. It was a split second decision, driven by
        emotion. I had no plans, no direction & no future - though no one really
        runs away from home unless they're being chased.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I think about it now, the only regret I have is not taking that
        step sooner. My life begun when I made the choice to leave & when I made
        the choice to jump into the unknown. I wish I didn't spend most of my
        life silently accepting & enduring.

        I've spent a lot of my life in grief, mourning for the
        experiences/upbringing I felt I'd deserved & was robbed of. In
        hindsight, I'm grateful I've come out the other side, the person I am
        today.

        I've become someone who actively strives to be better. Shifting
        perspective/s, questioning everything, reflecting
        consistently/constantly - these practices are important to me. I have a
        desire to live my life fully, present in all of its good and bad. To
        live auto-pilot in contentment, is the same as death to me.

        I've worked in retail for nearly 10 years now. The experience & skills

          Taking intiative. You can't wait for others to tell you what you need
          to hear, you can't wait for the world to "give you a sign". Ask
          yourself the relevant questions to improve and ask yourself regularly.

          Resilience. I've worked in many fast pace work environments, I've

      My downfall is my laziness. I've spent a majority of my life in a state of
      hyper vigilance. So I've stepped into my young adult years & I'm all burnt
      out. It's hard for me to keep the bigger picture in mind when in the
      present, I'm exhausted.

      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other

        It's so cliche. I was in university and it was my very first group
        project. I was working with two other people who basically just refused
        to work. Ultimately they contributed nothing & ultimately I came to the
        conclusion that it was out of my control.
      </p>

      <p>
        I decided to take initiative with the project. Instead of seeing this
        situation as "This is so unfair, I can't believe I'm stuck doing this
        whole project by myself", I re-shifted perspectives and began to see it
        as "It's a blessing to have full control over this project. I decide the
        outcome of this situation".

        The day before the presentation, I met with my group & I presented them
        with scripts, detailing everything they needed to learn. Presentation
        day came, we presented. The results came, we got full marks. In
        hindsight, I wish I'd had the courage to speak with my professor & to
        present my presentation by myself.
