      <h3>Defining Te Whare Tapa Wha</h3>
      <p>
        Te Whare Tapa Wha is a concept used in Māori health and well-being. It
        compares a person's well-being to the four walls of a house. Each wall
        represents a different aspect of health.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea is that all these aspects need to be structured - strong and
        balanced, like the walls of a house, for a person to be truly healthy
        and well.
