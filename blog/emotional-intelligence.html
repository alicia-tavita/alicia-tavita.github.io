    <h1>The Importance of Emotional Intelligence</h1>

    <h3>EQ vs IQ</h3>
    <p>
      We're gonna be looking at two acronyms today, EQ and IQ. Before discussing
      them, we'll need to know the differences between them:
    </p>
    <p>EQ</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Emotional quotient</li>
      <li>Measure of emotional competency</li>
      <li>Involves identifying, controlling, and using emotions</li>
      <li>
        Affects motivation, empathy, relationships, self-awareness, and
        self-control
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>IQ</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Intelligence quotient</li>
      <li>Measure of cognitive abilities</li>
      <li>Involves processing, knowledge, memory, and reasoning</li>
      <li>Affects academics, expertise, critical thinking, and logic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The foundation of EQ:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Self Awareness</li>
      <li>Self Management</li>
      <li>Social Awareness</li>
      <li>Relationship Management</li>
    </ul>

      <h3>Being human is awfully confusing</h3>

      <p>
        Each person is wired & built differently, no one is one and the same;
        the only rule is we're alive. As our lives transpire, we live to become
        more and more complicated. Funnily enough, often when we're asked what
        we want to be, a common answer is "Happy." Having a high EQ can help you
        live a happier life.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is an art to getting along with other people. There is a large
        array of differences that separates you from the people around you.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Having a low EQ might look like: Doing what's easiest & gravitating
          towards people who are very similar & alike to yourself - evading
          those who are 'too different' from you and those who you disagree
          with.
        </li>
        <li>
          Having a high EQ might look like: Accepting not everyone is for you,
          just like you're not for everyone. Approaching those you do not agree
          with, with an open-mind, from a place of curiousity, with an intention
          to understand.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When you refuse to step into discomfort, you rob yourself of an
        authentic human experience. When we have the ability to look outside of
        ourselves and to see ourselves & other people within the bigger picture,
        we not only gain the ability to coexist with others harmoniously but the
        ability to question & to grow.
      </p>
      <h3>A friendly reminder that:</h3>
      <p>
        It takes time, it takes effort. Just like everything you've ever worked
        for in your life, emotional intelligence is not something you've
        inherited. It is an active choice & requires work. It requires practice,
        it requires patience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as you can recount your life & appreciate how big and vast your
        experience has been - so can everyone else. There is a lot to be gained
        & a lot to love in the world outside of yourself. In saying this, as
        much as you should respect others, you should also respect yourself.
      </p>

      <h3>Check in with yourself</h3>
      <p>
        It's important to be in-tune with our environment & to be self-aware in
        how we treat others. On the flip-side it's also important, if not more
        so, to be in-tune with ourselves. We are not machines or robots; there
        isn't an
        <i>infinite resource</i> for us to be able to tap into & take from.
      </p>
      <p>
        We get hungry, thirsty, tired. Sometimes we don't have the capacity to
        lend an ear to a friend in need. We don't have the capacity to be as
        social as we'd like. We don't have the capacity to go do over-time again
        at work. We have needs and we have a duty to listen to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence looks like, being your own priority. Knowing
        where you yourself stand. Spending time with yourself, by yourself. You
        are the one greatest narrator of your own life.
      </p>
      <h3>Personally,</h3>
      <p>
        I am someone who believes that all things require balance. There is a
        difference between being content and moving forwards because of it &
        being content and staying where you are. Place yourself into whatever
        makes you uncomfortable, jump into the unknown, seek to learn and to
        grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        You shouldn't dwell in places like the past of the future for too long -
        be in the present. If you're gonna dwell in the past, reflect back on
        what you've learnt reading this blog entry.
