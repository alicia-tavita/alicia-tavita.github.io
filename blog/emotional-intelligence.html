      <p>
        We're gonna be looking at two acronyms today, EQ and IQ. Before
        discussing them, we'll need to know the differences between them:
      </p>
      <p>EQ</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Emotional quotient</li>
        <li>Measure of emotional competency</li>
        <li>Involves identifying, controlling, and using emotions</li>
        <li>
          Affects motivation, empathy, relationships, self-awareness, and
          self-control
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>IQ</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Intelligence quotient</li>
        <li>Measure of cognitive abilities</li>
        <li>Involves processing, knowledge, memory, and reasoning</li>
        <li>Affects academics, expertise, critical thinking, and logic</li>
      </ul>

          Being human is awfully confusing. Each person is wired & built
          differently, no one is one and the same; the only rule is we live and
          as our life transpires, we live to become more and more complicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an art to getting along with other people. There is a large
          array of differences that separates you from the people around you.
          You may find yourself doing what's easiest & gravitate towards people
          who are very similar & alike to yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think when you refuse to step into discomfort & you refuse your own
          curiousities, you rob yourself of an authentic human experience. When
          we have the ability to look outside of ourselves and to see ourselves
          & other people within the bigger picture, we gain the ability to
          coexist with other people harmoniously. It's important to note, this
          is an active choice & requires work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like everything you've ever worked for in your life, emotional
          intelligence is not something you've inherited. It's something that
          you've worked on, regardless of whether you've done this intentionally
          or not. Emotional intelligence is a lifestyle, it's something that
          requires maintenance. If you don't attune yourself to practicing what
          you've learnt, you're prone to losing it - forgetting it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's important to remember, just as you can recount your life &
          appreciate how big and vast your experience has been - so can everyone
          else. There is a lot to be gained & a lot to love in the world outside
          of yourself. This also applies going inwards. Just as much as you
          should respect others, you should also respect yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          As important as it is to be in-tune with our environment & to be
          self-aware in how we treat others, it is also important for us to have
          a desire to be selfish. We are not machines or robots; there isn't an
          <i>infinite resource</i> for us to be able to tap into & take from. We
          get hungry, thirsty, tired. Sometimes we don't have the capacity to
          lend an ear to a friend, we don't have the capacity to be as social as
          we'd like, we don't have the capacity to go do over-time again at
          work. We have needs and we have a duty to listen to them as we are our
          own keepers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence also looks like, being your own priority.
          Knowing where you yourself stand. Spending time with yourself, taking
          care of yourself, speaking with yourself. You are the one greatest
          narrator of your own life. You shouldn't dwell in places like the past
          of the future for too long - be in the present, with yourself, by
          yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am someone who believes that all things require balance. I am also
          someone who believes that all things require a solid foundation. As
          someone who holds these beliefs, I feel it's of utmost importance for
          everyone to be striving to be more emotionally intelligent. I know
          Drake's cancelled now but like Drake once said, "Everybody dies, but
          not everybody lives."
