      <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    </center>
    <center><h3>EQ vs IQ</h3></center>
    <p>
      We're gonna be looking at two acronyms today, EQ and IQ. Before discussing
      them, we'll need to know the differences between them:
    </p>
    <p>EQ</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Emotional quotient</li>
      <li>Measure of emotional competency</li>
      <li>Involves identifying, controlling, and using emotions</li>
      <li>
        Affects motivation, empathy, relationships, self-awareness, and
        self-control
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>IQ</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Intelligence quotient</li>
      <li>Measure of cognitive abilities</li>
      <li>Involves processing, knowledge, memory, and reasoning</li>
      <li>Affects academics, expertise, critical thinking, and logic</li>
    </ul>
    <center><h3>The Importance of Emotional Intelligence</h3></center>

    <body class="padding">
      <p>
        <u>Being human is awfully confusing.</u> Each person is wired & built
        differently, no one is one and the same; the only rule is we're alive.
        As our lives transpire, we live to become more and more complicated.
        Funnily enough, often when we're asked what we want to be, a common
        answer is "Happy." Having a high EQ can help you live a happier life.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is an art to getting along with other people. There is a large
        array of differences that separates you from the people around you.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Having a low EQ might look like: Doing what's easiest & gravitating
          towards people who are very similar & alike to yourself - evading
          those who are 'too different' from you and those who you disagree
          with.
        </li>
        <li>
          Having a high EQ might look like: Accepting not everyone is for you,
          just like you're not for everyone. Approaching those you do not agree
          with, with an open-mind, from a place of curiousity, with an intention
          to understand.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When you refuse to step into discomfort, you rob yourself of an
        authentic human experience. When we have the ability to look outside of
        ourselves and to see ourselves & other people within the bigger picture,
        we not only gain the ability to coexist with others harmoniously but the
        ability to question & to grow.
      </p>

      <p>The four horse-men of EQ:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Self Awareness</li>
        <li>Self Management</li>
        <li>Social Awareness</li>
        <li>Relationship Management</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <u>It takes time, it takes effort.</u> Just like everything you've ever
        worked for in your life, emotional intelligence is not something you've
        inherited. It is an active choice & requires work.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important to remember, just as you can recount your life &
        appreciate how big and vast your experience has been - so can everyone
        else. There is a lot to be gained & a lot to love in the world outside
        of yourself. This also applies going inwards. Just as much as you should
        respect others, you should also respect yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        As important as it is to be in-tune with our environment & to be
        self-aware in how we treat others, it is also important for us to have a
        desire to be selfish. We are not machines or robots; there isn't an
        <i>infinite resource</i> for us to be able to tap into & take from. We
        get hungry, thirsty, tired. Sometimes we don't have the capacity to lend
        an ear to a friend in need. We don't have the capacity to be as social
        as we'd like. We don't have the capacity to go do over-time again at
        work. We have needs and we have a duty to listen to them as we are our
        own keepers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>Check in with yourself.</u> Emotional intelligence also looks like,
        being your own priority. Knowing where you yourself stand. Spending time
        with yourself, by yourself. You are the one greatest narrator of your
        own life. You shouldn't dwell in places like the past of the future for
        too long - be in the present.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am someone who believes that all things require balance. There is a
        difference between being content and moving forwards because of it &
        being content and staying where you are. Place yourself into whatever
        makes you uncomfortable, jump into the unknown, seek to learn and to
        grow.
