      <h3>What is Neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity allows the brain the ability to adapt and change,
        influencing how we learn, recover from injury, and develop throughout
        our lives. It involves the brain's capacity to form new neural
        connections (synapses) and neural pathways.

      <h3>Basics of Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>
        Here are a few Neuroplasticity Principles to get you started. This is
        just a brief introduction. If you want to learn more about
        Neuroplasticity Principles and more, I've included some
        <a href="#extraResources">extra resources.</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use it or lose it</li>
        The brain gets better at things you do often. If you stop using a skill
        or knowledge, you might forget it.
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>Neurons that fire together wire together</li>
        When you think or do something, specific brain cells connect with each
        other. The more you do that activity, the stronger these connections
        become.
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>Your environment matters</li>
        Your experiences and surroundings influence how your brain grows and
        changes. Positive and stimulating environments can help your brain
        develop better.
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>It's never too late</li>
        It's a common misconception that, once you hit a certain age, you
        plateau in learning. Although it may be easier to learn & pick up things
        when you're younger, your brain still has the ability to change and
        learn new things throughout your adult life.
      </ul>

      <p>
        Here are a few exercises and practices you can add to your daily routine
        to boost neuroplasticity and in-turn, improve your overall health and
        well-being.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Actively learn new things</li>
        Engage your brain in challenging activities. Learn a new skill, pick up
        that hobby you've been interested in!
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>Use brain-training exercises</li>
        Challenge your brain to keep it sharp! Practice tasks that require focus
        and problem-solving.
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>Practice mindfulness and meditation</li>
        Activities like meditation or deep breathing can help reduce stress and
        improve brain flexibility. Practicing mindfulness and reducing stress
        promotes emotional well-being and can help support a healthy brain.
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>Be social</li>
        Socialization is a necessity. It's important to foster community and
        support - it's also essential to your health. Spending time with friends
        and family keeps your brain active and engaged.
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>Stay physically active</li>
        Engage in regular exercize. Regular exercize helps your brain stay
        healthy and adaptable.
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>Maintain a balanced diet</li>
        A balanced diet and drinking enough water keeps your brain nourished and
        functioning well.
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>Get enough quality sleep</li>
        Sleep supports memory and brain function. Do keep in mind, it doesn't
        matter
        <i>how much</i>
        sleep you're getting - what really matters is
        <i>how well</i>
        you're sleeping. Quality over quantity.

      <h3>What is Growth Mindset?</h3>

      <p>
        A growth mindset is the self-belief that you're able to improve your own
        abilities and intelligence over time by working hard and learning from
        mistakes. It's about seeing challenges as opportuinities to learn and
        grow, not as barriers.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the flip side, a fixed mindset is thinking your abilities are set in
        stone, which can make you avoid challenges and give up easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a growth mindset helps you bounce back from setbacks, stay
        motivated, and feel confident taking on new things, which can really
        boost your personal and professional growth.

        In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, I've been interested in human psychology for most of my
        life. I'd say it's more of a curiousity and less of an obsession these
        days; I just watch the odd video essays every now and then as they pop
        up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I knew most of what we've looked at through out this
        exploration, it was really fun to touch on these topics again and to
        develop my knowledge surrounding it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="quest">
        How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm someone who has strong beliefs, morals & values - one of them being
        your perspective is your reality. In this sense, I believe I have a good
        foundation and starting point for practicing and nurturing a growth
        mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
        The area I think I could really benefit from developing my learning in
        is <a href="#promotingNeuroplasticity">promoting neuroplasticity</a>. I
        am self-aware enough where, most of the time, I know what I should be
        doing. I am self sabotaging enough where, I more often than not,
        purposefully ignore these thoughts and prompts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been meaning to apply and action all the exercises and practices
        listed in the "Promoting Neuroplasticity" section in my own life for the
        longest time now. These are steps I know I should be taking because they
        will lead me closer to the life and place I envision for myself right
        now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity only bears fruit for those who fully commit and embody
        it's lifestyle, it's almost religious. You can't reap the results
        overnight. Effort alone isn't enough, you need consistency. My clash
        with this is evident - I'm lazy, impatient and self sabotaging.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enrolled in this course because I wanted to fully dedicate myself to
        being better. I see my own potential - acknowledging it isn't enough, I
        want to physically recognize it. I never want to feel comfortable or
        complacent again.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p class="quest">
        Blend with your learning plan and strategies, reflect and discuss how
        these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and
        strategy.
      </p>
      <p>For now, the plan is to take it one day at a time.</p>
      <p>
        I just recently quit the job I've been at for the past 3 years. I'm
        unemployed for the first time in 13 years. Right now I feel extremely
        overwhelmed - I don't know if I like having this much freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        With my new-found abundance in freedom and free-time, hopefully I'll be
        able to explore what Neuroplasticity and improving it looks like to me.
        I hope to look at some of the practices and figure out how to make it
        accessible and enjoyable to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only thing I've to be wary of at this time is biting off too much. I
        don't want to pressure or shame myself into progress. I want to flourish
        through nurturing and positive affirmations, taking it one day at a a
        time.
