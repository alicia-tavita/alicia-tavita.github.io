What is your long term goal or career pathway?

I chose to develop myself in the IT field because there is immense potential. To be quite frank, I have no 5 year plan. My future is very unclear to me, I've got no idea as for what I want to do with my life. The catch is I value freedom. I wanted to allow myself the grace & room to be able to decide as I go. I'm confident in my abilities to succeed in this industry, there's endless opportunity for up-skilling & space for growth. This is enough for me.
