Planning:

What is my site's primary purpose?
It is to function as a blog to showcase in my course

Who is my audience? (is it kids, adults, academics)?
I'm guessing/thinking my peers/tutors

How will I build my site to support their user experience?
Have a simple, cohesive, working website

Wireframe - can I draw my site layout on paper? Draw it!
I can't wireframe it but I'll try it when I get home

What will my site layout look like on a mobile phone? On a tablet? On a desktop?
It should adapt to the users experience - nothing should break

What other directories do I need (e.g. images)? Where do I put that directory?
I might have a link linking to another page with my film portfolio

Do I also want the style to be applied to all of my blog entries?
Maybe, I'll decide later down the line
